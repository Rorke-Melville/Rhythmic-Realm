# Rhythmic Realm

Welcome to **Rhythmic Realm**, a funky, neon-soaked web app I whipped up just for kicks! This site’s all about diving into the world of electronic beats with a slick, synthwave-inspired vibe. Think glowing reds (#ff0000), deep purples (#620075), and a dash of retro-futuristic flair. It is not mobile responsive just yet so please view on a PC or laptop. 

## What It Does

Rhythmic Realm is your one-stop spot to explore electronic music and club culture. Here’s what you’ll find:

- **Recommended Songs**: A curated list of banging tracks with vibes to get your head nodding.
- **Festival Recommendations**: Hot picks for electronic music festivals to plan your next rave adventure.
- **Artist Spotlight**: Shoutouts to dope artists lighting up the scene.
- **Synth Puzzle Course**: A quirky, interactive way to sign up for courses
- **Club Recommendations**: A dope 3D globe showcasing top clubs worldwide, complete with vibes and DJ highlights.

## Features

- **Neon Navbar**: Fades in smoothly when you scroll, with a clickable logo that spins 90 degrees to reveal an offcanvas menu.
- **Offcanvas Menu**: Glows with a red shadow, linking to all sections with a smooth scroll offset so headings stay visible.
- **Strobe & Cursor Effects**: Flashy visuals and a custom cursor to keep the energy pumping.
- **Volume Simulator**: A playful widget to tweak your imaginary beats.

## How It’s Built

This is a React app spiced up with:
- **Three.js**: For that sweet 3D globe in Club Recommendations.
- **Bootstrap**: Powers the offcanvas menu with a synthwave twist.
- **CSS**: Custom neon gradients, shadows, and text effects for that 80s cyberpunk feel.

## Why I Made It
Pure fun! I wanted to mess around with React, Three.js, and some wild styling while celebrating my love for electronic music. No big mission—just beats, vibes, and a good time.

## Shoutout
Big thanks to xAI’s Grok for helping debug the navbar fade, offcanvas menu, and scroll offsets—couldn’t have done it without that AI wizardry!
